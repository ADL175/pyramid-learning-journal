We also learned about functional testing and graph data structures. Today Carlos and I are working on learning journal stuff, finishing up step 3 and doing tests for step 3. I also plan on meeting w Erik and Carlos this weekend to catch up on our assignments. Otherwise, been going to a lot of meetups, but I will have to start balancing out meetups and class, because right now its starting to wear me down.'},
    {'journal_id': 13, 'title': 'June 1, 2017: Journal', 'date': 'June 1, 2017', 'body': 'Today during class we reviewed BinHeap data strutures and code review of step 2 on the learning journal. For class, we learned about SQLAlchemy, models and postgres. During lab, Carlos and I got stuck on the learning journal assigment for step 3. Ely offered his help and he showed us how he uses PDB, which I had seen, but hadnt used. Afterwards, Nick helped us and it got to working, but we will have to implement a work around to deploy the DB to heroku. Today, after class, I went to a meetup at Axon, which was a great opportunity. I met some great Axon employees and learned a lot about their products. I also won a raffle prize!'},
    {'journal_id': 12, 'title': 'May 31, 2017: Journal', 'date': 'May 31, 2017', 'body': 'Today we implemented models, postgres and SQL. Carlos and I worked on the journal project and we got stuck. Ely helped us through a lot of the problems with loading information to the database. Ely showed us how he uses PDB and it was very helpful. Last night, I went to Avvo w some class members for a Ruby meetup. Tonight a couple of us are going to Axon meetup. I am meeting with my partner Eric and Carlos this weekend to finish up the project.'},
    {'journal_id': 11, 'title': 'May 31, 2017: Journal', 'date': 'May 31, 2017', 'body': 'Today we learned about templating via jinja2. We also learned about Binary Heap. Nick did a code review of my learning journal, which was very helpful for me. Carlos and I pair programmed on the learning journal and we were able to get the server to load properly. Today we also picked groups for our projects. Our project, TweetGrams was voted for and we have a pretty awesome team. Tonight, a couple of us are going to Avvo for a meetup tonight.'},
    {'journal_id': 10, 'title': 'May 26 2017: Journal', 'date': 'May 26, 2017', 'body': 'This weekend was rough, trying to get most of the work done on the server. The server was tough  and it was depressing not being able to get it up and running. Today we went over Pyramid, which was way easier than building our server, but there were still some growing pains with the assignment. Carlos and I partnered up and tried to problem solve it. Eventually, we were able to get it up and running. Trying to stay positive and practice deliberately.'},
    {'journal_id': 9, 'title': 'May 25, 2017: Journal', 'date': 'May 25, 2017', 'body': 'Today we went on a long code review of our server script, which was helpful, until it broke, lol. Today, Chris, Miguel, and Ely did their lightning talks and they went well. Also today for lunch was Big Boys Filipino Food Truck, which is awesome. For labs, Miguel and I worked on the script to get to step 2, which we somewhat figured out. Now we need to do tests for step 2. For data structures, Erik and I will plan to work late on Friday on the data structures since Erik had other plans.'},
    {'journal_id': 8, 'title': 'May 24, 2017: Journal', 'date': 'May 24, 2017', 'body':'Today in class we learned about super classes, sub classes, pytest fixtures and doubly linked lists. We also did a code challenge to write a function that can return whether a linked list is cyclical. The class is moving fast and I need to make sure I vocalize my questions more frequently. For pair programming, Erik had figured out most of the doubly linked list, which was mostly the same as a linked list w/ some modification. The doubly linked list and tests were finished fairly quickly. Since we finished so early and our server partners were working on the data structure, Erik and I worked on the http server, which was good for me to see a different solution. Later, some CF students and I went to the Tech job fair and met some tech industry devs to network. I was able to get a couple contacts at  Capitol One, Evernote and met some interesting new people.'},
    {'journal_id': 7, 'title': 'May 23, 2017: Journal', 'date': 'May 23, 2017', 'body': 'Today we did code review on last nights homework (single linked list and socket server), which was very enlightening. Today we learned about stack data structures, HTTP servers and object inheritance and composition. Today during lab, worked w/ Erik and Ron for stack data structure, which was mostly completed. Miguel and I worked on http socket server, which we were able to get working. Last night, I went to the JS hacknight at Avvo, which went well. They fed us like normal, which was nice. Somewhat caught up now...'},
    {'journal_id': 6, 'title': 'May 22, 2017: Journal', 'date': 'May 22, 2017', 'body': 'Weekend went well. On Friday, I was able to finish the code challenges and tests for the challenges. Sunday I worked w/ Lynn and Kurt to finish the mailroom app, which was complete as an MVP, but requires some improved testing. Today, we learned about linked-lists, socket connections, TCP/IP, and code review. It seemed mostly straight forward, but it was not easy and here I am at 2200 hours typing a learning journal. Today, worked on labs w/ Ron and Erik for linked lists and Miguel for socket server. Both labs had their challenges, but the partners were knowledgeable and its good to work w/ new partners to see different styles of work. Erik was not able to be in class, so we worked remotely via Skype which worked surprisingly well. There was a point Miguel started working on his own very quickly while driving, and coding on his own.'},
    {'journal_id': 5, 'title': 'May 19, 2017: Journal', 'date': 'May 19, 2017', 'body': 'Today worked on and finished code challenges. Wanted to work on mailroom stuff, but realized the code challenge due at midnight... So much work. Checked out a little bit of the JS/iOS presentations today, but couldnt stay long since I had to work on code wars stuffs. I enjoyed the code wars stuff, the time hack deterred me from taking on the really challenging ones, so I focused on 6kyu challenges, which some were actually really 8kyu... Planning on coming in Sunday to work on stuff too. Unfortuntely, my partner for week 1 was not available Thurs/Fri, so I coordinated w/ Lynn and Kurt to work w/ them since they had not done mailroom yet.'},
    {'journal_id': 4, 'title': 'May 18, 2017: Journal', 'date': 'May 18, 2017', 'body': 'Today got some help from students and TA to get kata trigrams to function and test properly. Having some trouble utilizing the setup.py. Working on Mailroom madness stuff today. Feels like Im falling behind on assignments, trying to keep up. I plan on coming in on weekend to knock out as much as possible.'},
    {'journal_id': 3, 'title': 'May 17, 2017: Journal', 'date': 'May 17, 2017', 'body': 'Todays assignment was pretty tough. Munir helped Zach and I a lot. Then it got late and Chris stuck around to help us out. ITS STILL NOT WORKING @ 8:57PM!!! Otherwise, I really like the class structure, the instruction, and the TAs are awesome. They have great availability, expertise, and helpfulness.'},
    {'journal_id': 2, 'title': 'May 16, 2017: Journal', 'date': 'May 16, 2017', 'body': 'Today our lab consisted of writing tests and using virtual environments to install packages. We tested the Fibonacci and Lucas sequence. After the two sequences, Zach and I worked on the third function, which we had a hard time w/ because we didnt understand what the intended input and output were supposed to be. After a lot of tutoring by TAs and student, Kurt, we got to the solution. Afterwards, we understand the concepts much better. Yesterday night, we went to Avvo meetup which Nick arranged. We had a chance to meet their senior devs. The experience was excellent and most of us were interested in putting in our applications to work there. It seems like a great place to start a dev career and grow to a real Jr. or Sr. Developer.'},
    {'journal_id': 1, 'title': 'May 15, 2017: Journal', 'date': 'May 15, 2017', 'body': 'Today was the first day of 401 Python. Spent the last week going over the prework and doing some extra work on Treehouse for their techdegree Python. I realized even though Python is a higher level language, it can be extremely powerful and complex. Todays class was pretty smooth, but its more of an intro to basic Python. Last week, I went to the Microsoft Build event on Friday and got a chance to see some cool new stuff. Today we are going to Avvo to do a tour which Nick arranged.'}
